# CV-Animal-Identification
Programming final project completed for CSE 5524 (Computer Vision) using Python for multi-species individual animal reidentification. 

The project report for a full description of this project is available for read in this repository, titled "Final Project Report". Project code is also available. 

Python packages the need installed are pytorch, numpy, cv2, sklearn, pandas, and pillow.
*** Make sure the constant CALCLUATE_THRESHOLD is set to False, and the constant PREDICT_TEST_DATA is set to True before running test.py. It will be difficult for a viewer of this project to run this code on their machine without guidance due to the complexity and number of files required that interlink. ***

*** Changing the line "datapath = 'datasets/animal-clef-2025/metadata.csv'" to "datapath = 'datasets/animal-clef-2025/metadata_small.csv' will run a short subsample of all the data ***

* Note: some files are too large to upload to that were used in the project. The main showcase here is the final project report.
